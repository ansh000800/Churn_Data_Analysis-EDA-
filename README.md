# 📊 Customer Churn EDA Project

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project focused on understanding **customer churn behavior** for a telecom company. The main objective is to analyze why customers are churning out and what factors are contributing to it.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 Performed **in-depth analysis** on a real-world customer churn dataset.
- 📈 Created **insightful visualizations** using Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- 🧼 Included **data preprocessing**: handled missing values, cleaned incorrect entries, and transformed data for better analysis.
- 📦 Dataset was imported using the **Kaggle API** directly into a Pandas DataFrame.
- 🧮 Used **NumPy** for numerical operations and efficient data handling.
- 📊 Plotted multiple dynamic charts:
  - Countplots
  - Histograms
  - Subplots (to compare multiple service features)
- 📉 Visualizations include churn breakdowns based on:
  - Internet service type
  - Online security
  - Device protection
  - Contract type
  - Tenure buckets
  - And many other service-related features

## 📌 EDA Goals

- Understand how many customers are churning.
- Analyze churn by services/features like:
  - Contract type
  - Internet usage
  - Streaming services
- Find **visual patterns** that highlight churn risk.
- Gain business insights that can help in **reducing churn**.

## 📷 Sample Visuals

> 📍 Countplot of Churn by Contract Type  
> 📍 Histogram of Tenure by Churn Status  
> 📍 Subplots comparing multiple services with churn

*Note: The visualizations are dynamic — they auto-update when the data changes.*

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Before starting the analysis, the data was cleaned and prepared:
- Removed null or missing values
- Corrected inconsistent entries
- Converted numeric flags (like `0`/`1`) into categorical (`Yes`/`No`) for clarity
